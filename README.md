# Calypso
#### Calypso is a basic python tool to compare 2 .fit and .fits pictures
##### The goal is to calculate and represent the proportion of 2 elements from the same point of view of an object, captured in 2 pictures with differents filters.
##### For example here we have M27 , first .fit is captured with oxygen filter, and the second with and hydrogen filtre

#### M27 in fit, with oxygen filter :

#### M27 in fit, with hydrogen filter :

#### For the comparaison, a pixel full of oxygen, without hydrogen is 100 % red, and a pixel full of hydrogen, without oxygen is 100 % blue.

#### Result, we can see ther is a lot of oxygen around M27, but inside M27, the hydrogen is bigger :

##### So don't forget to crop your file

##### In the most of the case, the result look dark, so Calypso generate a result with a better contrast :
